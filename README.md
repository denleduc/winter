# Winter (I like snow, that's why)
 A simple weather app fetching its data from OpenWeatherMap's API. It's been created while following The Odin Project. Its purpose was to manipulate asynchronous JavaScript and fetch data from an API.

Some info (in no particular order):

- It is fully responsive! (It's the first project I designed 'mobile-first')
- You can (if you tap/click on the main temperature) see the temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit!
- The background changes according to the weather
- Simple UI
- Dark mode
- Preferences are stored in localStorage

See it [live on my website](https://bussun.dev/projects/winter)! (broken link that should work again soon enough)

## Issues

- None than I can think of (feel free to open an issue if you happen to find one).

## Features to come:
- Replacing absolute units in my CSS
