# Winter (I like snow, that's why)
 A simple weather app fetching its data from OpenWeatherMap's API. It's been created while following The Odin Project. Its purpose was to manipulate asynchronous JavaScript and fetch data from an API.

Some info (in no particular order):

- It is fully responsive! (It's the first project I designed 'mobile-first')
- You can (if you tap/click on the main temperature) see the temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit!
- The background changes according to the weather
- Simple UI
- Dark mode
- Preferences are stored in localStorage
- UI can be set in both French and English

See it [live on the GitHub pages deployment](https://bussun.github.io/winter)!

## Issues

- None than I can think of (feel free to open an issue if you happen to find one).

## Features to come:
- None for now.
